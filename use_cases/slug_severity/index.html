Intensive slugging in oil and gas production systems such as separators poses critical operational risks, including: • Gas flaring, • Oil dripping events, • Costly production stops, and • Equipment damage requiring extensive repairs.

System specific Indicator (Digital Twin)\nDescription: Incorporates a digital twin of the aNected components (separator and drainage control system), simulating real-world operations to predict slugging behavior.

The framework is designed to be modular, allowing the client to adopt the level of analysis most suitable for their operational context and scale up as needed.\nImpact Once fully implemented, the Slugging Severity Indicators enable significant operational benefits, including:\nImproved Monitoring: Real-time evaluations allow for a proactive responses to slugging events, reducing the risk of unplanned production stops. Enhanced Reliability: Optimized separator and drainage system performance increase overall system reliability. Cost and Environmental Savings: Fewer flaring and oil dripping incidents minimize both operational costs and environmental impact. Future-Proofing: Improved evaluation of scenario modeling using commercial multiphase flow simulators to plan for future operations and mitigate potential risks.
