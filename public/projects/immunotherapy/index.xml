neuroscience in 2019. He has a background from computational astrophysics
where he wrote software for finding clusters of galaxies in cosmological N-body
simulations. His Ph.D. focused on quantifying uncertainties in computational
models of neurons and neural networks and he created a Python toolbox for
performing these calculations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alocias Mariadason</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/alocias/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/alocias/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alocias has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in physics from the University of Oslo, submitted
in spring 2018. The subject of the thesis was Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations
of Quantum dots constrained in single- and double well potentials. He solved
the numerical problem for both systems with new analytic expressions which had
not been explicitly done before and a newer method with roots in machine
learning to further improve upon the results.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
