&lt;a href="https://dais-project.eu/">Distributed Artificial Intelligent Systems - DAIS&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Together with our Norwegian partners Step Solutions and Jotne EPM, Expert Analytics is developing
methods for distributed artificial intelligence applied to high frequency data. This enables us to
monitor the health status of industry assets without having to send large amounts of data to the
cloud for analysis. This is particularly beneficiary for assets in remote locations with limited
access to bandwidth, like hydropower, shipping and offshore industry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Expert Analytics and scientific outreach</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/posts/ada_estbook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 20:09:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/posts/ada_estbook/</guid><description>&lt;p>A new book showcasing the scientific challenges to be tackled by the European Solar Telescope (EST) has just seen the light. EST is a 4-meter aperture telescope designed to investigate the Sun with unprecedented detail. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, it will help scientists understand the magnetic coupling of the solar atmosphere. EST will be the largest solar telescope ever built in Europe and it&amp;rsquo;s expected to see the so-called first light in 2027. EST is a pan-European project involving 18 countries and financed by EU&amp;rsquo;s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A series of short articles on the science problems to be addressed by EST were published on social
media between May 2018 and April 2020. The goal was to raise awareness of solar physics and the importance
of the future EST among a general, non-specialised audience. A total of 77 articles were written by professional
solar astronomers from 30 different European research centers and universities. All the articles are now collected in this book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Expert Analytics in the press: article about the Sun published in Spanish newspaper</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/posts/ada_newspaper_article/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/posts/ada_newspaper_article/</guid><description>&lt;p>What will happen to the Sun when it dies?&lt;/p>

A
lot of developers, it seems, are using Rust at their spare time for
pet projects, but few professionally. Some barriers were identified,
like the size of the community making it hard for businesses to commit
to developing production software in Rust. The community agreed to
take action and provide training at both beginner and intermediate
level to spread the language, which we think is an excellent and
active approach to overcome this issue.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
