EST is a 4-meter aperture telescope designed to investigate the Sun with unprecedented detail. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, it will help scientists understand the magnetic coupling of the solar atmosphere. EST will be the largest solar telescope ever built in Europe and it&rsquo;s expected to see the so-called first light in 2027. EST is a pan-European project involving 18 countries and financed by EU&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme.</p><p>A series of short articles on the science problems to be addressed by EST were published on social
media between May 2018 and April 2020. The goal was to raise awareness of solar physics and the importance
of the future EST among a general, non-specialised audience. A total of 77 articles were written by professional
solar astronomers from 30 different European research centers and universities. All the articles are now collected in this book.</p><p><a href=https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/ada/>Ada Ortiz-Carbonell</a> is editor and author of two articles in the book. She is a data scientist at Expert Analytics with a background in academia. Her field of research is Solar Physics, and in addition to doing research she communicates science in education & outreach activities.</p><p>The book can be downloaded as a free PDF file <a href="http://www.est-east.eu/est/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=788&amp;Itemid=622&amp;lang=en">here</a></p><p><img src=book_cover.png alt="Cover of the new EST education & outreach book"></p><section></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 926 12 490 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4792612490 class=clear>+47 926 12 490</a>
