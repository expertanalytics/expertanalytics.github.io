A
lot of developers, it seems, are using Rust at their spare time for
pet projects, but few professionally. Some barriers were identified,
like the size of the community making it hard for businesses to commit
to developing production software in Rust. The community agreed to
take action and provide training at both beginner and intermediate
level to spread the language, which we think is an excellent and
active approach to overcome this issue.</p><img src=/posts/johannes-rust-meetup/photo.jpg alt=Illustration>
