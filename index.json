This involved orchestrating machine learning models in both production and development environments to analyze patterns and predict quality metrics.

Intensive slugging in oil and gas production systems such as separators poses critical operational risks, including: • Gas flaring, • Oil dripping events, • Costly production stops, and • Equipment damage requiring extensive repairs. Our client, a major oil and gas operator, required a sophisticated solution to evaluate the severity of slugging as it enters a separator. The model has to handle varying levels of system knowledge, integrate seamlessly with existing operations and work in both real-time scenarios and for evaluation of large-scale simulation results of future operarions.\nApproach We developed a flexible, multi-level framework of Slugging Severity Indicators, tailored to the client’s system and data availability. The solution delivered insights at varying levels of granularity, based on the level of system instrumentation and available data:\nGeneral Indicator (Minimal System Knowledge)\nDescription: Spectral analysis of pressure and temperature variations (common measures at various points in the system) Application: Provides quick assessments with minimal system-specific input, enabling scalable deployment across diverse applications.

At this stage, ownership information is lost and to accurately identify it, measurements are done by dedicated multiphase flow meters for each field.\nThe primary challenge in this case stemmed from the Alvheim infrastructure, which limited the calibration of multiphase flow meters (MPFMs) to a single line rerouted to the Alvheim separator, causing it to exceed capacity. This necessitated production throttling or well shutdowns, resulting in significant production losses and operational inefficiencies.\nApproach To tackle the calibration challenges, Aker BP, in collaboration with Cognite and Expert Analytics, developed an innovative algorithm-based calibration method that significantly reduced the need for rerouting third-party flowlines. This approach aimed to streamline the calibration process by requiring only a single line to be rerouted, thereby alleviating the operational strain on the Alvheim separator.\nFurthermore, the new method offered the potential to eliminate rerouting altogether by leveraging planned production changes for calibration. This not only minimized production losses but also enhanced the efficiency of the calibration process, allowing Aker BP to maintain smoother operations and reduce the associated costs significantly.\nImpact The implementation of the algorithm-based calibration method had a profound impact on Aker BP by reducing deferrals by over 95%, which translated to an estimated annual savings of $3.5 Million.

This large variability in rate and composition makes it challenging to estimate the appropriate dose of chemicals needed to clean the waste water following regulations. Our customer was an automation company that wanted to both predict the rate of waste water on the inlet of a plant and estimate the composition of the sewer. The goal was to optimize the usage of chemicals.\nApproach To predict wastewater flow, we applied machine learning algorithms (XGBOOST, LSTM) using weather data from Norges vassdrags- og energidirektorat (NVE) and Open-Meteo APIs. By incorporating time-based features and relevant environmental variables, we improved prediction accuracy and effectively captured the cyclical patterns of water flow.\nTo support monitoring and decision-making, we developed a Streamlit application that allows users to train machine learning models and compare different models and feature sets to identify the most effective configuration. Once the optimal model is selected, the application displays real-time predictions alongside actual water flow measurements and relevant weather data. This setup enables clients to continuously evaluate model performance by comparing observed data against predictions.\nTo make the predictions understandable, we integrated SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the key factors driving each forecast. Additionally, we used OpenAI’s API to generate clear verbal explanations based on SHAP values and weather data, helping plant operators understand the reasons behind the predictions.\nImpact The solution delivered accurate water flow predictions and effectively managed missing data, enhancing the reliability and flexibility of forecasting. It provided control over model configurations and included explainable AI features, allowing developers and end-users to understand the factors influencing predictions. Additionally, the real-time dashboard supported decision-making, enabling the client to manage wastewater operations with precise and actionable insights.\nThe amount of chemicals used has decreased, as reported by the client.\n","permalink":"https://expertanalytics.no/use_cases/treat_smart/","summary":"We developed an application that uses a machine learning model trained on operational and weather data to predict the rate and composition of wastewater, optimizing chemical usage and reducing costs at treatment plants.","title":"Treat Smart"}]
