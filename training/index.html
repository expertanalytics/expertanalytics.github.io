teaching programming. A few of us even have long lecturing experience
at the Institute of Informatics at the University of Oslo.</p><p>We offer courses in a wide range of topics. Below you will find a few
of these topics, sorted by programming language. If you have something
in mind that is not listed, feel free to let us know. We can easily
tailor courses as needed, if it is inside our scope of knowledge.</p><article><details><summary>C&#43;&#43;</summary><p>C++ is a general-purpose programminglanguage that combines high-level
features like object-orientation with low-level memory
manipulation. Its low-level features make it a good choice for system
software and other performance-critical or resource-constrained
systems, while its high-level facilities give it great flexibility for
use in application software.</p><ul><li><a href=/training/cpp/introduction/>Introduction to C&#43;&#43;</a><li><a href=/training/cpp/numerical/>Numerical C&#43;&#43;</a><li><a href=/training/cpp/templating/>Templating and Metaprogramming</a><li><a href=/training/cpp/machine-learning/>Machine Learning</a></ul></details><details><summary>Python</summary><p>Python is versatile general purpose scripting language with a wide
range of applications. It focuses on readability, and is an excellent
platform for development in the open-source world as well as in the
enterprise. It is highly cross-platform compatible and allows for
building powerful applications from a minimal amount of code.</p><p>Python exists currently in both version 2 and 3. We at Expert
analytics teach both, but recommend version 3, if legacy doesn&rsquo;t
require the use of version 2.</p><ul><li><a href=/training/python/introduction/>Introduction to Python</a><li><a href=/training/python/numerical/>Numerical Python</a><li><a href=/training/python/gis/>Geographical Information Systems</a><li><a href=/training/python/statistics/>Statistical Inference</a><li><a href=/training/python/testing/>Testing Suites</a><li><a href=/training/python/deployment/>Deployment</a><li><a href=/training/python/web/>Web Development</a><li><a href=/training/python/machine-learning/>Machine Learning</a></ul></details><details><summary>Rust</summary><p>Rust is a modern systems programming language that guarantees thread
safety and runs without a runtime environment. As such, it does not
need a garbage collector and runs amazingly fast. We offer an
introduction course, where we teach the core concepts of the language.</p><ul></ul></details><details><summary>Cross-Language Integration</summary><p>Many programming languages provide application programming interfaces
that allow them to communicate with other languages through libraries
or services. In addition, many tools exist to ease the burden of
employing these interfaces, making using programs across multiple
languages much simpler.</p><ul><li><a href=/training/cross-language/c-python/>C/C&#43;&#43; and Python</a><li><a href=/training/cross-language/fortran-python/>Fortran and Python</a></ul></details><details><summary>Miscellaneous Topics</summary><p>These are courses for tools that do not associate directly with any
particular programming language or platform.</p><ul><li><a href=/training/other/git/>Git</a><li><a href=/training/other/regex/>Regular Expressions</a></ul></details></article></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
