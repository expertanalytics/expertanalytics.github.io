development. The by far most popular version control system is GIT,
with its wide range of advanced tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="course-content">Course Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this course we will give an introduction to GIT and its
functionality. We will go through interaction with repository,
branching and merging, and how to address some corner case problems.&lt;/p>

&lt;dt>GIT&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>Git is a widely used source code management system for software
development. It is a distributed revision control system with an
emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows.&lt;/dd>

programming language. It is a powerful tool for extracting meaningful
information out of unstructured sources. A regular expression is
mainly used in pattern matching with strings, or string matching,
i.e. &amp;ldquo;find and replace&amp;rdquo;-like operations. Using this little language,
you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to
match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses,
or TeX commands, or anything you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="course-content">Course Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this course the formal language of regular expression will be
introduced. Afterwards we will show how the language can be applied to
various test cases. We will also discuss the various regular
expression dialects and how to implement regular expressions in a
programming language like Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This course aims at the introduction to regular expression without any
prior knowledge about the language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some experience with &lt;a href="https://www.python.org">Python&lt;/a> can be an advantage.&lt;/p>

&lt;dt>Python Regular Expression&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto">Python regular expression
module&lt;/a> is
an implementation of regular expression made available from inside
of Python. The expression used here are the the Perl dialect, one of
the most popular dialects of regular expression.&lt;/dd>
