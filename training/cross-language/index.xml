considered a slow language. Any operation that is computationally
intensive requires the program to be as fast as possible to keep the
computational time to a minimum. To this extent, one can use a wrapper
between Python and C/C++: The computational bottlenecks can be
addressed in C/C++, while everything else can be done in Python.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this course we will give an introduction to Swig in Python. We will
go through how header files in C++ can be used to create a connection
to create modules in Python. The course will also show how to
integrate other languages as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;dt>Swig&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>&lt;a href="http://www.swig.org">Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
(SWIG)&lt;/a> is an open-source software tool used to
connect computer programs or libraries written in C or C++ with
scripting languages such as Python. SWIG will compile an interface
file and generate code in regular C/C++ and the target programming
language through shared libraries.&lt;/dd>

especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. It
was once the dominating programming language in numerical intensive
fields, such as physics, mechanics, chemistry and high-performance
computing. To make use of the code developed in Fortran, it is prudent
to integrate the code into other languages. One integration approach
is to us f2py to integrate it into Python.&lt;/p>

&lt;dt>F2Py&lt;/dt>
&lt;dd>&lt;a href="http://www.f2py.com/">f2py&lt;/a> is an interface generator that provides
a connection between Python and Fortran. It is a Python extension
tool for creating Python C/API modules from signature files.&lt;/dd>
