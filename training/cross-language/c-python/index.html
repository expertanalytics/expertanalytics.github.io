considered a slow language. Any operation that is computationally
intensive requires the program to be as fast as possible to keep the
computational time to a minimum. To this extent, one can use a wrapper
between Python and C/C++: The computational bottlenecks can be
addressed in C/C++, while everything else can be done in Python.</p><h2 id=course-content>Course Content</h2><p>In this course we will give an introduction to Swig in Python. We will
go through how header files in C++ can be used to create a connection
to create modules in Python. The course will also show how to
integrate other languages as well.</p><h2 id=prerequisite>Prerequisite</h2><p>This course requires some familiarity with the C++ programming

(SWIG)</a> is an open-source software tool used to
connect computer programs or libraries written in C or C++ with
scripting languages such as Python. SWIG will compile an interface
file and generate code in regular C/C++ and the target programming
language through shared libraries.</dd></dl></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
