model with power consumers, producers, and transmission lines, down to the
individual reservoirs and hydro power stations and pumps in coupled water
courses. This is done by running simulation software that outputs a fairly
large amount of data in the range of 15 - 20 GB each time a simulation is run.</p><p><img src=/img/powerline.jpg alt=Electricity></p><p>We have helped building an analysis platform for this problem that contains a
domain model in which simulation results are inserted after they are computed.
Furthermore, we have developed advanced techniques for retrieving and
visualizing the results in terms of time series data and statistics, along with
advanced aggregation of results to allow forecasts to be viewed in ways earlier
not feasible.</p></section><h3>Consultants:</h3><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/andreas/andreas_hu17763110654146460397.png class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/andreas/>Andreas Slyngstad</a></h3><p>Andreas submitted his master’s thesis in applied mathematics from the
University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory. In his thesis he
investigated numerical schemes, for solving equations describing
Fluid-Structure Interaction, using Python and FEniCS. His academic background
has given him several tools and approaches for solving complex problems in a
computational/software domain.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/diako/diako_hu580749996427506997.jpg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/diako/>Diako Darian</a></h3><p>Diako holds a Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from the University of Oslo. As
a student at both Mathematics and Physics departments at the University of Oslo,
he has acquired a broad knowledge in various physical and mathematical theories,

Tveten</a></h3><p>Gry is a curious, efficient and pragmatic problem solver. She completed her PhD in experimental nuclear physics at the University of Oslo in 2013 and most of her PhD work was carried out at CERN. She has 6 years of post doc experience. Her recent work focused on understanding how the elements are created in stellar processes. This research required developing detection systems, analyzing data, visualization and carrying out complex simulations. She has also teaching experience, including course development at university level and has led her own projects since she completed her PhD.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/ola/ola_hu15159968322894084664.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/ola/>Ola Skavhaug</a></h3>Founder and CEO of Expert Analytics.
