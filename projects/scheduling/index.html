A customer wanted to optimise their allocation of manpower relative to demand.
We have developed and implemented a full system that:</p><ul><li>Forecasts customer behaviour based on historical data, Facebook Prophet and basic statistics.</li><li>Optimises work schedules based on Google optimization tools.</li><li>Pushes the resulting schedules into their time-management system.</li></ul></section><h3>Consultants:</h3><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/guttorm/guttorm_hud40b9279f0f65154f62b3f46f3f886aa_31973_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/guttorm/>Guttorm Kvaal</a></h3><p>Guttorm is a curious person with an interest and enthusiasm for
