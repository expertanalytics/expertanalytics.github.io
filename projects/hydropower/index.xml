Marty is well known in Norway and much further afield for his knowledge when it comes to Edge Analytics, predictive maintenance and energy trading.
He’s spent his last ten years building automated control systems, leading Nordic software development at Statkraft, solving complex Edge analytics problems for maritime, manufacturing, construction &amp;amp; energy and has been an executive technical lead for a range of organisations.
At weekends you’ll find Marty in different countries either competing racing superbikes or using his low level software skills to modify motorcycle engine control systems where he’s built his own analytics platform and predictive traction control systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pia Zacharias</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/pia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/pia/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pia is a physicist with more than ten years of experience in scientific
programming and data analysis. She holds a PhD in physics, which she obtained
from the University of Freiburg, Germany in 2010. She has been working as a
researcher, mentor and lecturer in astrophysics at different research
institutions across Europe before she joined Expert Analytics in 2018.
Her areas of expertise include numerical simulations of complex physical systems,
statistical data analysis and signal processing, as well machine learning applications
and visualization and handling of large datasets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vinzenz Gregor Eck</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/vinzenz/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/vinzenz/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vinzenz is a curious, pragmatic, creative problem solver. He holds a
PhD in biomechanical engineering, focusing on stochastic simulations
