hydropower set out to explore the potential of digitalization for its hydropower
plants. Our team of consultants developed a machine learning platform, the surrounding
backend infrastructure as well as visualization tools to explore and analyse
sensor data for both specific use cases as well as across the entire fleet.</p><p><img src=/img/hydro.jpg alt=Hydropower></p><p>We explore the data in close collaboration with the maintenance team on site and apply
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to monitor various kinds of failure modes
from slowly developing failures over time to repeating failures in the auxiliary equipment.
This kind of condition monintoring supports the daily maintenance by improving the
predictability of wear and asset failures, thus reducing operating costs and the need for
costly and time-consuming manual inspections.</p></section><h3>Consultants:</h3><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/pia/pia_hu738416e47e9340ab17bd1e4d3c66776f_1675442_400x0_resize_box_3.png class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/pia/>Pia Zacharias</a></h3><p>Pia is a physicist with more than ten years of experience in scientific
programming and data analysis. She holds a PhD in physics, which she obtained
from the University of Freiburg, Germany in 2010. She has been working as a
researcher, mentor and lecturer in astrophysics at different research
institutions across Europe before she joined Expert Analytics in 2018.
Her areas of expertise include numerical simulations of complex physical systems,
statistical data analysis and signal processing, as well machine learning applications
and visualization and handling of large datasets.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/vinzenz/vinzenz_hu6052f41a4e7af620028b299459026b9a_16332_400x0_resize_box_3.png class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/vinzenz/>Vinzenz Gregor Eck</a></h3><p>Vinzenz is a curious, pragmatic, creative problem solver. He holds a
PhD in biomechanical engineering, focusing on stochastic simulations
