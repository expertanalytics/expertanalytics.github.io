hydrological forecasting, and hired one of our consultants to
help. We ended up reimplementing the whole system, using modern
templated C++, and equipping it with a Python interface. The new
system, called Shyft, runs several hundred times faster than the old
prototype, and is currently used both operationally at Statkraft and
as a research tool by hydrologists in academia. Shyft is open
source, and can be found at <a href=https://github.com/statkraft/shyft>https://github.com/statkraft/shyft</a> and
<a href=http://shyft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>http://shyft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Long term power production planning involves resolving a
comprehensive market model with power consumers, producers, and
transmission lines, down to the individual reservoirs and hydro
power stations in coupled water courses. This is done by running
simulation software that outputs a fairly large amount of data in
the range of 15 - 20 GB each time a simulation is run. We have
helped building an analysis platform for this problem that contains
a domain model in which simulation results are inserted after they
are computed. Furthermore, we have developed advanced techniques for
retrieving and visualizing the results in terms of time series data
and statistics, along with advanced aggregation of results to allow
forecasts to be viewed in ways earlier not feasible.</p></li><li><p>A customer wanted to optimise their allocation of manpower relative
to demand. We have developed and implemented a full system from
demand forecasting based on historical data, to optimised work
schedules (based on Google optimization tools), and implementation
in their time-management system.</p></li><li><p>A small bioinformatics software company is trying to disrupt in
precision cancer immunotherapy. They marked themselves using machine
learning to predict the effect of a therapy. One of our consultant
went in and took the role developing the backbone of the scientific
platform implementing state-of-the-art machine learning applied on
observational protein data scaling on the range of 10-20 GB. The
algorithms include support vector machine, random forest, artificial
neural network, and topic modeling. Some of these machine learning
implementations are currently (as of May 2018) marked leading within
their applications.</p></li><li><p>Mobile payments&mdash;Since 2013, we have been involved in projects with
Norwegian companies building mobile payment systems; mCash, Auka,
and Vipps. Our involvement have mostly been on the backend, working
on core transaction and settlement logic as well as internal and
external APIs. When working on payment systems, the concepts of data
consistency, idempotent operations, and fault-tolerant operations
need to be well understood. In order for the system to perform well
under load, it is required to understand the relevant performance
characteristics of the system including e.g. modern cloud
infrastructures. Through the years, we have built domain knowledge
within the field of mobile payments that we now can apply with
existing and new customers working on problems in the financial
sector. The technologies we have applied in this field are mainly
Python and Go, deployed on the Google App Engine and Azure
stacks. Both relational and document database models have been used.</p></li></ul></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
