cancer immunotherapy. They marked themselves using machine learning to predict
the effect of a therapy.</p><p><img src=/img/cancer.jpg alt="Cancer cells"></p><p>One of our consultant went in and took the role developing the backbone of the
scientific platform implementing state-of-the-art machine learning applied on
observational protein data scaling on the range of 10-20 GB. The algorithms
include support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural network, and
topic modeling. Some of these machine learning implementations are currently
(as of May 2018) marked leading within their applications.</p></section><h3>Consultants:</h3><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/alocias/alocias_hu27f7dc34c9db8fd2b063f3fba6be9864_324114_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/alocias/>Alocias Mariadason</a></h3><p>Alocias has a master&rsquo;s degree in physics from the University of Oslo, submitted
in spring 2018. The subject of the thesis was Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations
of Quantum dots constrained in single- and double well potentials. He solved
the numerical problem for both systems with new analytic expressions which had
not been explicitly done before and a newer method with roots in machine
learning to further improve upon the results.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/simen/simen_huc47dca3d48b18186b26c04c30f113190_7515_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/simen/>Simen Tennøe</a></h3><p>Simen is a computational scientist who finished his Ph.D. in computational
neuroscience in 2019. He has a background from computational astrophysics
where he wrote software for finding clusters of galaxies in cosmological N-body
simulations. His Ph.D. focused on quantifying uncertainties in computational
models of neurons and neural networks and he created a Python toolbox for
performing these calculations.</p></div></article></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 926 12 490 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4792612490 class=clear>+47 926 12 490</a>
