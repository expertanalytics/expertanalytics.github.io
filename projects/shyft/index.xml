completed in 2018. In his thesis he studied two different models of particle
production at high energies, one statistical using the thermodynamical
equations and one using the properties of a theoretical particle called
Pomeron.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eivind Storm Aarn√¶s</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/eivind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/eivind/</guid><description>&lt;p>Eivind has a masters degree in Computational Science from the
University of Oslo, completed in 2016. His project investigated a
particle system modeling linear elasticity, and accelerating linear
algebra computations using GPUs. From the studies leading to his
degree he has gained broad knowledge about algorithms, numerical
mathematics, and programming in several languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ola Skavhaug</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/ola/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/ola/</guid><description>Founder and CEO of Expert Analytics.
