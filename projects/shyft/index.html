detailed understanding of the hydrological state is of paramount importance in
Norwegian hydropower production.</p><p><img src=/img/hydrology.jpg alt="Spring in Norway"></p><p>Statkraft needed help to operationalize a prototype for distributed
hydrological forecasting, and hired one of our consultants to
help. We ended up reimplementing the whole system, using modern
templated C++, and equipping it with a Python interface. The new
system, called Shyft, runs several hundred times faster than the old
prototype, and is currently used both operationally at Statkraft and
as a research tool by hydrologists in academia. Shyft is open
source and distributed using the LGPL license.</p><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/shyft-os/shyft>Source code on Gitlab</a></li><li><a href=http://shyft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>Documentation</a></li></ul></section><h3>Consultants:</h3><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/eivind/eivind_hu13339713877602565289.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/eivind/>Eivind Storm Aarnæs</a></h3><p>Eivind has a masters degree in Computational Science from the
University of Oslo, completed in 2016. His project investigated a
particle system modeling linear elasticity, and accelerating linear
algebra computations using GPUs. From the studies leading to his
degree he has gained broad knowledge about algorithms, numerical
mathematics, and programming in several languages.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/ola/ola_hu8977909621115146117.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/ola/>Ola Skavhaug</a></h3>Founder and CEO of Expert Analytics.

production at high energies, one statistical using the thermodynamical
equations and one using the properties of a theoretical particle called
Pomeron.</p></div></article></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 926 12 490 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4792612490 class=clear>+47 926 12 490</a>
