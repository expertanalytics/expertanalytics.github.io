detailed understanding of the hydrological state is of paramount importance in
Norwegian hydropower production.</p><p><img src=/img/hydrology.jpg alt="Spring in Norway"></p><p>Statkraft needed help to operationalize a prototype for distributed
hydrological forecasting, and hired one of our consultants to
help. We ended up reimplementing the whole system, using modern
templated C++, and equipping it with a Python interface. The new
system, called Shyft, runs several hundred times faster than the old
prototype, and is currently used both operationally at Statkraft and
as a research tool by hydrologists in academia. Shyft is open
source and distributed using the LGPL license.</p><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=https://gitlab.com/shyft-os/shyft>Source code on Gitlab</a></li><li><a href=http://shyft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>Documentation</a></li></ul></section><h3>Consultants:</h3><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/andreas/andreas_hu96faaa2ed5f62963d33ba6b0309498dd_530771_400x0_resize_box_3.png class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/andreas/>Andreas Slyngstad</a></h3><p>Andreas submitted his master’s thesis in applied mathematics from the
University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory. In his thesis he
investigated numerical schemes, for solving equations describing
Fluid-Structure Interaction, using Python and FEniCS. His academic background
has given him several tools and approaches for solving complex problems in a
computational/software domain.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/eivind/eivind_hu403063eafeef9471218c8b3e4b7b6f1f_24553_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/eivind/>Eivind Storm Aarnæs</a></h3><p>Eivind has a masters degree in Computational Science from the
University of Oslo, completed in 2016. His project investigated a
particle system modeling linear elasticity, and accelerating linear
algebra computations using GPUs. From the studies leading to his
degree he has gained broad knowledge about algorithms, numerical
mathematics, and programming in several languages.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/ola/ola_hu8c02324b7fb9be93ca5854759aedc2e4_10491_400x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/ola/>Ola Skavhaug</a></h3>Founder and CSO of Expert Analytics.

completed in 2018. In his thesis he studied two different models of particle
production at high energies, one statistical using the thermodynamical
equations and one using the properties of a theoretical particle called
Pomeron.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/vinzenz/vinzenz_hu6052f41a4e7af620028b299459026b9a_16332_400x0_resize_box_3.png class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/vinzenz/>Vinzenz Gregor Eck</a></h3><p>Vinzenz is a curious, pragmatic, creative problem solver. He holds a
PhD in biomechanical engineering, focusing on stochastic simulations
of the blood flow in the human arterial system. This interdisciplinary
work included working within engineering, medicine, biology, software
development and statistics.</p></div></article></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 900 69 915 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4790069915 class=clear>+47 900 69 915</a>
