new topics and combining them into novel solutions to complex
problems. He received his PhD in biocomputional sciences in
March 2021 from the Italian Institute of Technology/University
of Bologna, where he studied how nanomaterials interact with
physiological environments. He is experienced in molecular
simulations, data visualization, and scientific writing.
In more recent years, Sebastian has been applying bioinformatic
methods to genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data.</p><p>During his PhD, Sebastian managed large amounts of data
(hundreds of gigabytes) generated from molecular simulations.
In this type of computation, numerical methods are used to
iteratively solve coupled differential equations, which in turn
offers an atomic description of physicochemical processes.</p><p>When approaching a scientific problem, Sebastian looks
for inspiration in Nature, which has perfected behaviors
(e.g. preying strategies) over millions of years.</p><p>Sebastian is particularly drawn to creative, unconventional
ways of displaying data. He is passionate about generative art,
dancing, and animals. His values are based on critical thinking,
diversity, inclusion, and teaching.</p></section><section><h3>Services:</h3><ul><li><a href=https://expertanalytics.no/services/datascience/>Data Science and Machine Learning</a><li><a href=https://expertanalytics.no/services/visualization/>Advanced Data Visualization</a></ul></section></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 900 69 915 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4790069915 class=clear>+47 900 69 915</a>
