technology and problem solving. His academic background is focused
around applied mathematics, programming, and physics. He submitted his
master’s thesis the summer 2017 in the field of Computational Science
and Engineering at the University of Oslo / Simula. In his work he
performed numerical simulations of micro-particles inhaled into the
human respiratory system. This involved writing Python scripts as well
as modifying and working with open-source libraries, in addition to
data analysis and supercomputer simulations.</p><p>While working at Expert Analytics, he has continued developing his
programming skills in Python and Go, and has been diving into topics
such as machine learning and web programming.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
