the University of Oslo in 2018. The subject of his thesis was Monte
Carlo simulations of quantum dots constrained to different potential
wells. For his thesis he developed software in C++ and Python, but he
has experience with C and Java as well. His education has given him
experience in solving complex physical and mathematical problems using
various numerical methods and libraries. This has made him an
experienced programmer and he is good at adapting to new systems as
well as learning new programming languages.</p><p>For the past year, he has worked with Python development in the public
transportation sector for Ruter As.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
