2016. During his time as a student, he got exposed to several programming
languages, such as R, Python, Scheme, Java, and Javascript. In his work
experience following that, first as a consultant for Knowit and then as a
software engineer for Cognite, he spent a lot of time in the JVM world with
Java and Scala.</p><p>Stian believes in letting the compiler and linting tools do as much work as
possible because then he as the developer has fewer options to shoot himself in
the foot. Following that, he is an eager supporter of strict, functional
languages such as Haskell and Scala.</p><p>Stian is a pragmatic programmer with the ability to see the world from the
user&rsquo;s perspective, and can thus see their problems and create real solutions.
He also has experience being the link between a development team and the
customer, having been a tech lead for a small development team in a previous
job.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
