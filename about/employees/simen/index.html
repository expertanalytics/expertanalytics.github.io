neuroscience in 2019.
He has a background from computational astrophysics where he wrote software for
finding clusters of galaxies in cosmological N-body simulations.
His Ph.D. focused on quantifying uncertainties in computational models of
neurons and neural networks and he created a Python toolbox for
performing these calculations.
Additionally,
the work included creating a new specification for data storage,
data analysis,
and developing an educational neural network simulator.
Simen also has teaching experience and has co-authored a textbook that teaches
first-semester bachelor students in biology programming,
data analysis,
and computational modeling.</p><p>Simen has experience at learning new disciplines
and enjoys using the computer to solve complex problems,
create models and numerical simulations and perform data analysis.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
