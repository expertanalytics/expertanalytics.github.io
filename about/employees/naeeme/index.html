project engineer. Before joining our team, she worked in the field of 3D
modelling and CFD simulation of reactive and non-reactive flows, employing
high-performance computing and immersive virtual reality environments to
optimize the performance of industrial units. This allowed her to gain
experience in solving complex problems using her expertise in software
development combined with her knowledge in fluid dynamics, chemical
thermodynamics, mass and heat transfer.</p><p>Naeeme holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in chemical engineering and a master&rsquo;s degree
in environmental engineering. During her career, she worked intensively in
developing software for 3D modelling of complex geometries (mesh generation) and
advanced data visualization in 2D and 3D environments.</p><p>Working as a project engineer made her an expert in the analysis of measurement
data in industrial units, as well as the interpretation and the visualization of
such data in an understandable manner. She also had the chance to work closely
with engineers in different fields, sometimes climb up a 100 meters boiler,
sometimes look at sugar production or paper factories.</p></section><section><h3>Services:</h3><ul><li><a href=https://expertanalytics.no/services/hpc/>High Performance Computing</a><li><a href=https://expertanalytics.no/services/visualization/>Advanced Data Visualization</a></ul></section></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 900 69 915 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4790069915 class=clear>+47 900 69 915</a>
