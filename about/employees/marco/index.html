a strong focus on quantum and classical atomistic simulation methods.
Throughout his decade-long career he has worked on both software development -
mainly in C++ and Python - and research intensive projects across several
research fields ranging from low-temperature physics to computational chemistry
and biophysics. This experience, along with his robust mathematical and
coding background, allows him to be a broad and thorough problem solver, well
capable of working both independently and as a team member.</p><p>Since 2005 Marco worked on a rich variety of projects. To name a few,
he worked on a porting of a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation software from
Fortan77 to C++. He later designed and developed parallel simulation
software for quantum many-body systems adsorbed on various substrates,
tools for the solution of inverse problems (i.e. the inversion of the
numerical Laplace transform from noisy data) based on Genetic Algorithms,
atomistic simulation libraries for chemical systems with hybrid
openMP/MPICH parallelization, non-linear fitting strategies for Molecular
Dynamics thermostats based on generalizations of the Langevin Equation,
a Python script that implements some Enhanced Sampling methods in Gromacs,
and more recently coordinated the development of a C++14 program for quantum
dynamical simulations based on the Feynman&rsquo;s Path Integral. He worked on
several physical and mathematical problems including Superfluidity and Supersolidity,
the negative sign problem affecting sampling algorithms, Enhanced Sampling of
high dimensional probability distributions, and the problem of quantum transport
in protein channels.</p></section><section><h3>Service:</h3><ul><li><a href=https://expertanalytics.no/services/hpc/>High Performance Computing</a></ul></section></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 926 12 490 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4792612490 class=clear>+47 926 12 490</a>
