Engineering at the University of Oslo in 2016. His educational
background is in mathematics and computational science applied on
mechanical problems using numerical methods. This has fuelled his
interest for science and technology. He has mainly used Python and has
substantial experience using numerical libraries such as Numpy/Scipy
and FEniCS. He is also familiar with C/C++ and Java. His experience
includes teaching introductory Python at the University of Oslo,
mostly in one-to-one settings.</p><p>Before joining Expert Analytics he was engaged as a Research Engineer
at Simula Research Laboratory. In his thesis he simulated the
cerebrospinal fluid flow in patient specific geometries. He solved
partial differential equations with the finite element method using
supercomputers, both in his master&rsquo;s thesis and during his work at
Simula. Through his education and work he has gained significant
experience with numerical simulations and mathematical modelling, as
well as problem solving in general.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
