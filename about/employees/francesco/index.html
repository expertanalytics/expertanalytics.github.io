The subject of his PhD thesis was the extraction of nuclear properties from experimental data, and their use in astrophysical settings, such as the origin of heavy elements. He acquired expertise in nuclear physics and astrophysics, but also Python programming, statistics, experiment planning and data analysis. He likes solving complex problems, developing algorithms, and has keen interest in visualizing and presenting data.</p><p>Before his PhD, Francesco studied neutron stars at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway, and plasma physics at UiT in Tromsø, Norway. These are both complex subjects blending topics such as general relativity, thermodynamics, electrodynamics, fluid dynamics, quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory. During his academic journey, he developed skills in Python programming, data analysis, model simulations of complex nuclear and astrophysical systems, error propagation and data visualisation, as well as teaching, team collaboration and science communication.</p></section><section></section></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 926 12 490 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4792612490 class=clear>+47 926 12 490</a>
