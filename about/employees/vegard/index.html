University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory in 2019 and worked as a researcher at Simula between 2019 and 2023. In his research he worked with health data, mathematical models and computer simulations to understand fluid flow in the human brain. Both physical based (differential equations) and data driven (statistical, machine learning) models were used in his research.</p><p>In addition to his scientific contributions, Vegard served as the leader of the Scientific Computing section at Simula between 2021 and 2023 and obtained valuable skills in mentoring, leadership and communication. Furthermore, he has lectured courses on data science both at BI Norwegian Business School and at the University of Oslo, giving him a broad understanding of applications within data science as well as efficient communication on the subject.</p></section><section></section></main><footer><span class=hide-if-mobile>+47 900 69 915 | post@expertanalytics.no | Org nr 924 651 946 | © Expert Analytics AS</span><div class=mobile-footer><a href=tel:+4790069915 class=clear>+47 900 69 915</a>
