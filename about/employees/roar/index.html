completed in 2018. In his thesis he studied two different models of particle
production at high energies, one statistical using the thermodynamical
equations and one using the properties of a theoretical particle called
Pomeron. He also has a practical background working as an electrician.
All through his studies he worked with C, C++ and Python, but is adaptable
to new systems and languages.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
