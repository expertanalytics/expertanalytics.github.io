subject of the thesis was Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations of Quantum dots constrained in single- and
double well potentials. He solved the numerical problem for both systems with new analytic
expressions which had not been explicitly done before and a newer method with roots in machine
learning to further improve upon the results. Solving these complex systems gave him a varied skill
set within the fields of numerical methods, statistical analysis, mathematical optimization,
symbolic computation and high performance computing. This has made him experienced in programming
with multiple languages and skilled in efficient algorithmic approaches.</p><p>With his education in Computational Physics and a curious mindset, Alocias is a positive learner and
well-adapted for solving complex problems.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
