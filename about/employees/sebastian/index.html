University of Oslo and Simula Research Laboratory, finished
in 2017. In his thesis he built a Fluid-Structure Interaction solver
with Python using the FEniCS platform. This also included working with
supercomputers parallelizing the computational efforts. During his
studies he gained knowledge in algorithms, numerical computing and
programming in different languages.</p><p>After graduating he worked for Shortcut AS, an app-development
company, developing iOS apps and working with Splunk for monitoring
and analyzing machine-generated big data. He has also taken courses
and attended conferences on AI/Machine Learning, learning neural
networks using Tensorflow, Keras, scikit-learn.</p><p>Apart from that he is highly adaptable to any situation and can
quickly learn new languages and frameworks.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
