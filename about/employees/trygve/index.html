NTNU in 2015, and has submitted a Ph.D. in Computational
Mathematics at the University of Oslo in 2019. In his thesis
Trygve developed, analysed and implemented efficient algorithms
for solving systems of equations related to fluid flow in the brain.
As such, he has substantial experience in development of numerical
computer code &ndash; mainly in Python, C and C++, and related libraries
and tools for multi-language programming.</p><p>Trygve is analytical, curious and easily fascinated. This makes him
eager to learn and well-adapted to work both as part of a team, and
independently.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
