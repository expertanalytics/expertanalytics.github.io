science and more than a decade of software engineering experience from
research and industry. This combination of a solid educational
background in mathematics and computer science, research and
supervision experience, and lots of practical software engineering
experience allows him to tackle most development problems as a team
player or independently if need be.</p><p>He has worked on a wide range of software types including: web tools
for scientific visualization using WebGL and JavaScript; embedded
audio DSP programming in C; music sequencer software in C++; tools for
diff and merge of Jupyter notebooks in Python; utilities for build and
test systems in Python; high performance numerical computations in C++
and Fortran; mixed language API design for C++/Python libraries;
automated C++ code generation tools with just in time compilation from
Python; a declarative domain specific language and symbolic
mathematics library for partial differential equations in Python; and
software for solving partial differential equations and flow problems.</p></main><footer><p>© Expert Analytics AS</p></footer></body></html>
