raw data, whether that is applied to research or to industry. Extracting
meaning from and interpreting data requires tools and methods of multiple
disciplines such as mathematics, statistics, physics and computer science.</p><p>In Expert Analytics we apply the scientific method as a pillar to obtain
valuable knowledge out of data. This usually includes a combination of
designing experiments, collecting data from various sources, processing
and cleaning the data to be analyzed, making hypothesis, analyzing and
interpreting the data, drawing conclusions and presenting them in an
understandable manner, all with the aim of supporting decision-making in the
industry. In today&rsquo;s business world, data analysis plays a fundamental role in
helping businesses operate more effectively.</p><p>Examples of data science applications useful in an industrial environment are
the detection of anomalies in the normal functioning of expensive heavy
machinery, where data from sensors are used to predict maintenance operations
or schedule stops in production. Other examples are optimisation problems where
production (and thus benefits) is maximized, maintenance operations minimized
within safety regulations, and optimization of work schedules in terms of the
allocation of manpower relative to demand.</p><p>Our data scientists have an academic background in the natural sciences, where
analysis of complex datasets and critical thinking are keys to advance
knowledge and publish results in scientific journals. Our expertise spans from
physics, to mathematics, to statistics and computer science, and we have
experience in presenting difficult-to-understand concepts in a comprehensible
language.</p></section><div>Contact Point: <a href=mailto:vinzenz@xal.no>vinzenz@xal.no</a></div><div>Phone: +47 451 24 193</div><h2>Consultants:</h2><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/ada/ada_hu14703540566550755855.png class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/ada/>Ada Ortiz-Carbonell</a></h3>Ada is a senior researcher with 20 years of academic experience in the field of Astrophysics during which she taught, mentored students, organized several international conferences and led her own research projects.
