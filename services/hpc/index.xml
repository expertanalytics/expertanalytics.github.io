a strong focus on quantum and classical atomistic simulation methods.
Throughout his decade-long career he has worked on both software development -
mainly in C++ and Python - and research intensive projects across several
research fields ranging from low-temperature physics to computational chemistry
and biophysics. This experience, along with his robust mathematical and
coding background, allows him to be a broad and thorough problem solver, well
capable of working both independently and as a team member.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robert Solli</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/robert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/robert/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert Solli is a specialist in scientific programming, with expertise in
mathematical optimisation, statistical analysis and machine learning. He has
solved a varied set of problems with this skillset, from understanding complex
physical systems to increasing student volunteer participation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ata Karakci</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/ata/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/ata/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ata holds a PhD in physics with specialisation in astrophysics which he obtained from Brown University in 2014.

and numerical methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Roar Emaus</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/roar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/roar/</guid><description>&lt;p>Roar has a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in High Energy Physics from the University of Oslo,
completed in 2018. In his thesis he studied two different models of particle
production at high energies, one statistical using the thermodynamical
equations and one using the properties of a theoretical particle called
Pomeron.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alexander Fleischer</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/alexander/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/alexander/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alexander is a senior software developer specializing in backend and system
development in Python.
His experience with Python dates back to 2010, and he has been working
professionally with system development in Python since 2018.
During his career, he has worked in several platform and product teams
in both the public transport sector and the energy sector.
Alexander holds a master&amp;rsquo;s thesis in computational quantum physics from
the University of Oslo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eivind Storm Aarn√¶s</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/eivind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/eivind/</guid><description>&lt;p>Eivind has a masters degree in Computational Science from the
