She submitted her PhD thesis in Climate Science in December of 2021, and during her doctorate she analyzed radiation and air pollution data from a multitude of climate model simulations and compared them with observations. This work gave insight in big data analytics and visualisation, especially regarding time series and how to avoid common pitfalls like comparing apples and oranges. She enjoys working with large datasets, learning new things, and communicating/teaching science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Naeeme Danesh Moghaddam</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/naeeme/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/naeeme/</guid><description>&lt;p>Naeeme is an enthusiastic software developer with many years of experience as a
project engineer. Before joining our team, she worked in the field of 3D
modelling and CFD simulation of reactive and non-reactive flows, employing
high-performance computing and immersive virtual reality environments to
optimize the performance of industrial units. This allowed her to gain
experience in solving complex problems using her expertise in software
development combined with her knowledge in fluid dynamics, chemical
thermodynamics, mass and heat transfer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sebastian Franco Ulloa</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/sebas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/sebas/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sebastian is a curious person always looking to learn about
new topics and combining them into novel solutions to complex
problems. He received his PhD in biocomputional sciences in
March 2021 from the Italian Institute of Technology/University
of Bologna, where he studied how nanomaterials interact with
physiological environments. He is experienced in molecular
simulations, data visualization, and scientific writing.
In more recent years, Sebastian has been applying bioinformatic
methods to genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robert Solli</title><link>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/robert/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://expertanalytics.no/about/employees/robert/</guid><description>&lt;p>Robert Solli is a specialist in scientific programming, with expertise in
