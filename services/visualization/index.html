communication of data and analysis results. Especially these days where the
amount of data is often huge and traditional visualisation forms may not be
suitable. Treatments like data reduction or aggregation are then needed
to visualise the data efficiently.</p><p>Visualisation of data plays an important role in data science, machine learning
and analysis platforms. Raw data needs to be inspected, results of
computational simulations and algorithms need to verified, and the end-users
need insight into the data too. Given the large amounts of data available in
today&rsquo;s analyses, implementing efficient and responsive visualization software
is far from trivial.</p><p>Our consultants have expertise in standard and advanced data visualisation
techniques. This includes pretreatments such as reduction, aggregation and
contextualising of data. For more complex visualization of larger data sets, a
combination of different techniques is often required. For instance, deriving
some statistical measures across spatial, temporal and parametric dimensions
can be combined with blending techniques to provide novel visual insight.</p></section><h2>Consultants:</h2><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/daniel/daniel_hu15983817007453117120.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/daniel/>Daniel Marelius Bjørnstad</a></h3><p>Daniel is a seasoned software developer with a PhD in neuroscience, specializing in data analysis and cloud software

She submitted her PhD thesis in Climate Science in December of 2021, and during her doctorate she analyzed radiation and air pollution data from a multitude of climate model simulations and compared them with observations. This work gave insight in big data analytics and visualisation, especially regarding time series and how to avoid common pitfalls like comparing apples and oranges. She enjoys working with large datasets, learning new things, and communicating/teaching science.</p></div></article><article class=bio><img src=/about/employees/ola/ola_hu8977909621115146117.jpeg class=profilepic><div class=card><h3><a href=/about/employees/ola/>Ola Skavhaug</a></h3>Founder and CEO of Expert Analytics.
